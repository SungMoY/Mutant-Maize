      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>This document describes a game called "Mutant Maize". It is a 2D game with levels focused on a mix of side-scroller and platformer-jumping. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, side scrolling &amp; gravity, efficient memory management, render threading, and more basic 2D game techniques.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <p>Mutant Maize will be developed as a web-based game using the Wolfie2D game engine, a game engine written in Typescript created by Joe Weaver and Richard McKenna. Wolfie2D utilizes WebGL for rendering on the web browser. Artwork will be relatively simple. Piskel will be used to draw tilemaps and sprite sheets. Photoshop will be used to create the logo and level background images.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>BACK STORY</h3>
        <p>Rob the Cob is a mature ear of corn during the Fall. He doesn't know when gained sentience but continued to live out his days observing the world. Until one day he watches his friends and family be harvested by farmers, never to be seen or heard from again. The remaining corn whimpers of the horrors and experiments that the farmers exact on their lost comrades. When evening starts to roll around, the farmers stop for the day, Rob manages to escape the doom of being harvested. As night rolls in he equips himself with an arsenal of corn related tools, Rob seeks to escape the farmland and starts plans to build an army to seek revenge.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>Rob the Cob&rsquo;s objective is to make his way through the farm with the goal of exacting revenge for his fallen corn brethren and ultimately escaping. Rob will use corn-related tools to overcome any obstacles in his way. Obstacles that Rob will encounter are bugs and pests that like to feed on crops, as well as the difficult terrain of barns. Bosses will be objects in a generic farm that seem opposing from a cob of corn&rsquo;s perspective like a chicken and a dog.&nbsp;</p>
      <br>
      <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
        <p>Levels such as the cornfield and barnyard will be played as side-scrollers while levels with escalation will be played as a platform jumper. With side scrolling, with Rob the Cob able to run left and right, and jump up and down onto platforms and other surfaces. He is also able to grapple onto platforms to reach higher places or enemies to drag them closer. He is also able to shoot different projectiles to defeat enemies or to destroy certain platforms and environments. Platform jumping will have the same mechanics, escape with the primary goal of reaching the end goal through various different maneuvers. Some levels will focus on more verticality, some on maze/confined movement, or a mix of everything.</p>
        <p>Rob can use his silk as a grappling hook for movement and as a weapon against mobs. He can also shoot out kernels of corn as ranged fire. He can also collect solar energy inside him to charge up a shotgun blast of popcorn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Grappling has a weight class mechanic where the unit with lesser weight is moved towards the unit with greater weight class: Items &lt; Mobs &lt; Rob the Cob &lt; Platforms/Bosses/Walls</p>
        <p>Each level will have mobs and creeps that Rob must fight through.</p>
        <p>The 1st level features Rob traversing the cornfield, defeating mice roaming on the ground. This level should be relatively easy to complete and be a stomping ground for new players to get used to the mechanics and physics. Basic shooting and movement will be introduced here.</p>
        <p>The 2nd level features Rob jumping and climbing up a wall of a barn with the main adversaries being swooping birds. At the end of this level, Rob enters through a window. Grappling will be introduced here.</p>
        <p>The 3rd level is a boss fight against a chicken. The chicken will attack Rob in pattern-based combat, it is up to the player to identify the pattern and properly take advantage of windows to deal damage. The chicken attacks with periodic charges across the level and pecks. For a ranged attack, it will throw an egg at Rob. Rob can deal with this by shooting the egg before it hits him, or dodging it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The 4th level is the journey from the barn to the farmer&rsquo;s house. It will not be in a cornfield, but through a field of tomatoes, flowers, and other distinguishable produce. There will be mice and birds that will act as the main adversary. The shotgun/corngun will be introduced here.</p>
        <p>The 5th level is Rob escalating a wall up the farmer&rsquo;s house. It will be similar to the second level, but with a different background and platforms. There will be more platforming and will have a lot more bird adversaries to overcome.</p>
        <p>The 6th level is a boss fight against the farmer&rsquo;s dog. The dog will also utilize pattern-based combat. The dog has a pouncing attack and a biting attack.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>CONTROLS</h3>
        <p>This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once started, use the following:</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>ESC/P - This pauses the game and presents a pop-up window to the player asking them to continue when they are ready. If a game is not in progress, the buttons do nothing. And if the pop-up window is already up, it&rsquo;ll act as a way to resume the game.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some features will be introduced over the stages, such as Cornshooter, Corngun, and Grapple.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>
